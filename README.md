# postalcodeapp
This is a source code for A web application project called "What is my postal code",
i have developed this website to make it easy for anyone inside Egypt to get his/her postal code as easily as clicking a button.

the main idea of this application was to indicate user's geolocation latitude and logintude,
then calculating the distance between user location and most close post offices locations nearby and comes out with
the nearest post office with all information about this post office including the postal code, working hour, services available
and much more..

the main challenging part to get this idea into a live application was the data, the data of post offices all around the country 
which was available through Egypt post official website, the second part was to identify each post office's geolocation,
which was not available therefore i had to use many gelocation APIs to convert address to a geolocation latitude and longitude,
and here comes Google Map API which helped me most to make it.


this application was developed using PHP and codeigniter frmework with HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery
this repository include all project files except the datadump files, in cse you need it you are welcome to contact me.
